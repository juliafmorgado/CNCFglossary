## What it is

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

In RBAC, two objects are defined: roles and role bindings. 
Roles specify permissions on resources, dictating what actions users or a set of users can perform on those resources.  
Role bindings, on the other hand, designate **who** can assume these roles. 
This "who" can be a user or a set of users. 
This approach facilitates a streamlined access control process while reducing the complexity of managing permissions for individual users.

## Problem it addresses

RBAC addresses the challenge of limiting the resources team members and applications can access, as well as the actions they can take, 
particularly as the number of cluster nodes, applications, and team members increases.
Administrators must ensure that each user has the correct permissions for the resources they need to access, 
a task that can become unwieldy and error-prone without a structured access control mechanism.


## How it helps

By assigning specific permissions to roles, rather than individual users, RBAC streamlines the access control process. 
Team members are granted permissions based on their assigned roles, 
enabling them to perform their job functions efficiently. 
This approach ensures that users have the right level of access to resources, 
minimizing the risk of unauthorized or incorrect access. 
Overall, RBAC helps improve access management, security, and operational efficiency within organizations.
